# SwiftShield: Classification for Network Intrusion

## Overview

**SwiftShield** is a sophisticated Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that leverages machine learning techniques to address the escalating threat landscape in cybersecurity. The project develops a multi-class classifier to accurately detect and classify various types of network intrusions, thus mitigating risks posed by evolving cyber threats. The system is designed to enhance network security by offering robust defenses against both known and emerging attacks.

SwiftShield not only improves detection accuracy but also reduces the prevalence of false positives, a common issue in traditional NIDS. By incorporating advanced data preprocessing and feature selection techniques, SwiftShield ensures that the machine learning models are trained on the most relevant and high-quality data, leading to more reliable and efficient network protection.

## Abstract

SwiftShield implements a comprehensive approach to Network Intrusion Detection by developing a multi-class classifier capable of identifying diverse network intrusions. The system addresses the limitations of traditional NIDS by incorporating advanced data preprocessing techniques and leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, particularly XGBoost, to ensure high accuracy in intrusion detection.

## Introduction

Traditional NIDS primarily rely on signature-based detection methods, which are effective against known threats but struggle to detect novel or previously unseen attacks. SwiftShield addresses this gap by employing a machine learning approach, which enhances the system's ability to detect emerging cyber threats.

## Previous Work

The project builds upon existing research in network intrusion detection, comparing signature-based detection systems (SBDS) with anomaly-based detection systems (ABDS). ABDS, which focus on deviations from established norms, offer a more dynamic approach to detecting new threats. SwiftShield integrates these concepts, leveraging machine learning for more accurate intrusion detection.

## Methods

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removal of erroneous or incomplete data entries.
2. **One-Hot Encoding**: Conversion of categorical variables into numerical format.
3. **Normalization**: Scaling of numerical features to a standard range.
4. **Log Transformation**: Handling skewed data to achieve a more symmetrical distribution.
5. **Outlier Detection and Replacement**: Identification and mitigation of outlier effects.

### Feature Selection

Embedded feature selection using Random Forest to retain the most informative features for model training.

### Modeling

Several machine learning models were applied, including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost**

XGBoost demonstrated the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.9%.

## Results

The results of each model were compared using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and support. XGBoost outperformed other models in terms of both predictive power and operational efficiency.

## Problem Description

As cyber threats become more sophisticated, traditional NIDS are increasingly inadequate. SwiftShield aims to enhance the dynamism and accuracy of intrusion detection by leveraging machine learning to classify network traffic, ensuring better protection against a wide range of cyber threats.

## The Process

The project followed a structured process of data exploration, preprocessing, and model training, culminating in the implementation of a robust NIDS. A detailed flowchart of this process is provided in the report.

## Conclusion and Future Work

SwiftShield successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning to network intrusion detection, with XGBoost offering the best performance. Future work may involve exploring more complex models, such as deep neural networks, and developing a real-time intrusion detection system. Additionally, expanding SwiftShield to handle larger, more diverse datasets will further enhance its applicability in real-world network environments.
